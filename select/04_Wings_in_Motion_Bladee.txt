Crystalline bliss from within and everything clears up
You're still there, and more than that
Clears up, you're still there and more than that too
Ripples broken, wings in motion
Wings in motion, far from before
I'm on my hands again, the lonely fall
Again, again, all through the night
Ripples broken, wings in motion
Wings in motion, far from before
I'm on my hands again (and you're still there too)
Crystalline bliss from within and everything clears up
You're still there, and more than that
Clears up, you're still there and more than that too
Ripples broken, wings in motion
