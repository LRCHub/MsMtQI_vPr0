[00:04.56] For a long time I felt without style or grace
[00:06.86] Wearing shoes with no socks in cold weather
[00:11.25] I knew my heart was in the right place
[00:15.91] I knew I'd be able to do these things.
[00:34.91] 
[00:20.96] And as we watch him digging his own grave
[00:25.40] It is important to know that was where he's at
[00:30.20] He can't afford to stop... That is what he believe
[00:34.77] He'll keep on digging for a thousand years.
[00:56.27] 
[00:40.18] I'm walking a line-I'm thinking about empty motion
[00:48.98] I'm walking a line-Just barely enough to be living
[00:58.42] Get outa the way-No time to begin
[01:01.02] This isn't the time-So nothing was done
[01:03.47] Not talking about-Not many at all
[01:05.77] I'm turning around-No trouble at all
[01:08.44] You notice there's nothing around you, around you
[01:12.86] I'm walking a line-Divide and dissolve.
[01:32.36] 
[01:17.31] Never get to say much, never get to talk
[01:22.27] Tell us a little bit, but not too much
[01:26.99] Right about then, is where she give up
[01:31.96] She has closed her eyes, she has give up hope
[01:54.46] 
[01:36.05] I'm walking a line-I hate to be dreaming in motion
[01:45.73] I'm walking a line-Just barely enough to be living
[01:54.94] Get outa the way-No time to begin
[01:57.70] This isn't the time-So nothing was done
[02:00.09] Not talking about-Not many at all
[02:02.35] I'm turning around-No trouble at all
[02:04.80] I'm keeping my fingers behind me, 'hind me
[02:09.34] I'm walking a line-Divide and dissolve.
[02:28.84] 
[04:14.49] I turn myself around, I'm moving backwards and forwards
[04:15.42] I'm moving twice as much as I was before
[04:15.86] I'll keep on digging to the center of the Earth
[04:16.96] I'll be down in there moving the in the room...
[04:40.46] 
[04:17.77] I'm walking a line-Visiting houses in motion
[04:18.32] I'm walking a line-Just barely enough to be living
[04:19.26] Get outa the way-No time to begin
[04:19.84] This isn't the time-So nothing was done
[04:20.43] Not talking about-Not many at all
[04:21.05] I'm turning around-No trouble at all
[04:21.61] Two different houses surround you, 'round you
[04:22.11] I'm walking a line-Divide and dissolve.
