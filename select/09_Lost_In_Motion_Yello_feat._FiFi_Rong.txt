I don't know how to swim
But I try anyway

I've gotta make it
I'm gonna fake it

I don't know what pain is
But I've got bills to pay

Coming round here
I'm gonna die here

Lost in motion soul
Searching hard
Broken I die

I'm gonna work hard
Gonna make it last

I've gotta make it
I'm gonna die here

I've gotta make it
I'm gonna die here

Lost in motion soul
Searching hard
Broken I die
Trying hard
In motion soul

When soul comes to pass
I never learn to trust
Never learn to love

I don't know how to swim
But I try anyway

I've gotta make it
I'm going to die here

I've gotta make it
I'm gonna die here

I've gotta make it
I'm gonna die here

Lost in motion soul
Searching hard
Broken I die
Trying
Mmm mmm
