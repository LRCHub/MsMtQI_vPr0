(All aboard)

Train of love in motion
Heading for the ocean
It's powered by emotion
Train of love in motion

Put on your best dress
We're travelling light before the dawn
And where we're going
I'm not really sure
But there is one thing that I know
It is time for us to go
So all aboard
Let your feelings show
Here we go now

Train of love in motion
Heading for the ocean
It's powered by emotion
Train of love in motion

It doesn't matter
Whereever we should choose to meet
This locomotion
Will sweep us up on out feet
There is one thing that I know
This train's about to go
So all aboard
Let your feelings show
Here we go now

Train of love in motion
Heading for the ocean
It's powered by emotion
Train of love in motion
Heading for the ocean
It's powered by emotion
Train of love in motion
Heading for the ocean
It's powered by emotion
Train of love in motion
