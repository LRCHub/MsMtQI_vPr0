[00:08.24] I'm edging closer, shivers all over
[00:12.30] It's way too real, I'm way too sober
[00:16.30] Usually they've got you covered all over
[00:20.51] Lack of composure, I'm walking over
[00:24.82] What will I do?
[00:27.83] I never had a chance to
[00:39.33] 
[00:32.09] There's no one else around you
[00:36.28] Not that I was waiting, vision ever fading
[00:40.57] Heading for the deep end
[00:44.55] Soon as I remember, baby, I surrender
[00:48.90] I just need to breathe out
[00:52.93] Decision time approaching, reality in motion
[01:14.93] 
[01:02.44] Trying to be patient but I'm feeling ancient
[01:06.66] Trying to control the way that I'm facing
[01:11.59] Suppose that I didn't care anymore
[01:15.98] Fate can decide, I can ignore
[01:19.90] I'll just pretend that I always knew
[01:26.59] That I had the chance to
[01:38.59] 
[01:30.36] There's no one else around you
[01:34.54] Not that I was waiting, vision ever fading
[01:39.09] Making such a promise
[01:43.09] Only leads to heartache, closer to an earthquake
[01:47.33] Talked about in Hollywood
[01:51.30] Trying to stay in motion
[02:03.30] 
[01:56.16] It made my heart run in circles and overflow
[02:04.39] And I was closer than ever to letting go
[02:12.57] It made my heart run in circles and overdrive
[02:20.99] And I was closer than ever to feeling alive
[02:29.24] It made my heart run in circles and overflow
[02:37.60] And I was closer than ever to letting go
[02:46.21] It made my heart run in circles and overdrive
[02:54.29] And I was closer than ever to feeling alive
[03:15.79] 
[03:02.21] There's no one else around you
[03:06.62] Not that I was waiting, vision ever fading
[03:10.80] Heading for the deep end
[03:15.03] Soon as I remember, baby, I surrender
[03:19.05] I just need to breathe out
[03:23.00] Decision time approaching, reality in motion
[03:45.00] 
[03:27.52] Let's not think about it
[03:31.52] Put your arms around me, I can sense you doubt me
[03:35.75] You don't need to promise
[03:39.72] That only leads to heartache, closer to an earthquake
[03:44.16] Talked about in Hollywood
[03:56.66] 
[03:48.10] All there's left to do, all there's left to do
[03:52.29] All there's left to do, all there's left to do
[03:56.55] All there's left to do, all there's left to do
[04:00.68] All there's left to do, all there's left to do
[04:04.99] All there's left to do, all-
