World of understandin'
Livin' with hate
The heartbeat of compassion
A little bit too late
Never see the forest
Cuttin' down the trees
Some think that hunger
Is a channel on TV

I'm not a god I'm just a man
Alone I cannot save us in this hour
The spirit challenges the hand
And where there is love, there is power

There's somethin' deep inside
A faith that keeps this world alive
Reachin' out, let's put this (soul into motion)
Right to the heart of it
Can't stop it once you've started it
It's all about, puttin' this (soul into motion)

We glorify religion
Kill ourselves with dope
Suffer from indifference
Hang by threads of hope
When the ship is sinkin'
Still we stand on by
We can't wait to cross the bridge
Until the river's running dry

I'm not a god I'm just a man
Alone I cannot save us in this hour
The spirit challenges the hand
And where there is love, there is power...

There's somethin' deep inside
A faith that keeps this world alive
Reachin' out, let's put this (soul into motion)
Right to the heart of it
Can't stop it once you've started it
It's all about, puttin' this (soul into motion)

There's somethin' deep inside
A faith that keeps this world alive.
